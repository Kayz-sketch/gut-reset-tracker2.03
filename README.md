# 🥬 The Gut Reset Tracker Dashboard

An interactive Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to guide users through a 21-day functional medicine gut reset protocol.

Inspired by the principles of Dr. Will Cole (author of *Gut Feelings*), this tool helps users identify inflammatory triggers and build metabolic resilience.

## ✨ Features

### 1. The "Inflammation Bucket" Quiz
A visual intake form that calculates your current "inflammatory load" based on lifestyle factors (stress, diet, sleep) and visualizes it as a water bucket.

### 2. The 21-Day Tracker
- **Daily Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to save progress directly to the browser (no login required).
- **Core 4 Monitoring:** Tracks avoidance of Gluten, Sugar, Industrial Oils, and Conventional Dairy.
- **Habit Stacking:** Tracks positive inputs like Green Tea (EGCG) and mood.

### 3. "Eat This, Not That" Database
- Instant search engine for food swaps.
- Filters foods based on functional medicine principles (e.g., swapping White Rice for Resistant Starch or Cauliflower).

### 4. The "SOS" Panic Button
- A unique feature addressing "Shameflammation."
- Provides psychological re-framing when a user slips up on their diet, prioritizing stress reduction over perfectionism.
